# Monitization

### For Users

* Metaverse games frequently monetize based on virtual good transactions, which are interactive NFTs.
* All the transaction happens via **$SLNT** tokens.
* To play the game and use the free inventory items, users must **stake $SLNT** tokens in-game.
* Players who win weekly/monthly tournaments are rewarded $SLNT can be exchanged for MATIC coin.
* $SLNT can be used to purchase life in the game.
* Players can even buy **fractions of rare NFTs** on our platform. We recently partnered up with **Nibbl(**https://nibbl.xyz/**)** to fractionalize the NFTs.

### For Brands

* For exclusive brands, a one-time fee is **USD/USDT 6000 in $SLNT**.
* The profit margin from brands selling products from in-game inventory is **15%**. (custom products will design in-house for brands who will collaborate with us).
* While collaborating with us, Lunatic Games provides a platform for luxury brands to enter web3. The advantage of collaboration is that it provides valuable customers who live luxurious lifestyles.
