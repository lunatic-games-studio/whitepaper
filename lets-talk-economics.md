## Engagement Strategies

**Continuous goals:** The games assign specific goals for users to achieve. The game becomes more challenging and time-consuming as they advance in the game. They also provide frequent feedback on their performance. Every action will translate toward a certain goal that will be used to attain higher gaming capital.

**Gaming capitals:** Players are encouraged to earn different NFTs, badges, trophies, and accolades that indicate their progress and accomplishments. All this data is stored inside Blockchain as a public profile they can showcase. Some achievements are unlocked just by advancing in the game, while others may significantly alter the rationale behind the game and require extensive investment from players. The ways of gaining gaming capital are not limited to playing games but the games-related productive activities that are appreciated in the player's social circle. By accumulating gaming capital, they provide an intrinsic benefit to gamers as there is an avenue to boost their accomplishment and showcase their expertise in the game. The achievements are visible to their network of friends. Gaming capitals are a way for developers to increase replay value, provides extended playtime, and players get more value from the game.

### Motivation to collect gaming capital

* **Legitimization:** refers to society's willingness to approve or condone specific behavior. Collecting is about channeling one's materialistic desires into more meaningful pursuits. Game achievements serve a similar purpose, allowing players to justify the hours spent playing the game.
* **Self-extension:** Gathering and controlling meaningful objects or experiences can work to gain one an improved sense of self. The collector's goal to complete a collection symbolizes completing the self.

All of our games have different societies within them. To get better lifestyle products, they need to keep playing and upgrading in society. They will feel more valued when their society gets upgraded.

There is a certain amount of Lives they will hold. To buy more lives and continue playing, they need **more $SLNT tokens**.

## Monetization

Metaverse games frequently monetize based on virtual good transactions, which are interactive NFTs.

All the transaction happens via **$SLNT** tokens.

Players can even buy **fractions of rare NFTs** on our platform. We have recently partnered up with **Nibbl(**https://nibbl.xyz/**)** to fractionalize the NFTs.

## **The SLNT Token**

In all our games, the $SLNT token is a base currency using which all the transactions happen.

**It is an ERC20 token.** All the properties of an ERC20 token apply to the $SLNT token.

LNT token is a **Continuous token** that is powered by the **Bancor Bonding Curve**.

### Benefits of a Continuous token

* The price of the token is adjusted by **Bancor Bonding Curve**, this algorithm resides in the smart contract.
* No liquidity issues, minting, and burning of token is decided by the Bancor Bonding Curve algorithm.
* Rewarding multiple beneficiaries for the development of a project without their permission.
* The value of the network is more naturally tied to interest (fewer magic numbers). Networks are allowed to grow and die naturally.
