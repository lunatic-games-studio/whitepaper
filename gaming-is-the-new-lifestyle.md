# Gaming is the new lifestyle

Before we proceed, we like to discuss the meaning of the word "Lifestyle" here in this context, as this word is vague on its own.

## Lifestyle

> _Refers to the way a person lives. This includes patterns of social relations, food consumption, behaviors, and interests. A lifestyle typically reflects an individual's attitudes and one's interaction with the world._

## How does your life look inside a metaverse?

Imagine waking up one fine morning, you do your daily chores, and it's your standup time.

You wear your VR headset or sit in front of a computer. You join virtual breakfast with your family and friends who are physically distant from you, there is a piece of slow music playing, and you can see your friends sitting at a table virtually.

After you are done with your breakfast, it's time for your daily standup. You join them virtually, and you will find your virtual room a meeting room. Everyone is present there. You share your presentation, and then you start your work.

It's time for lunch, and you join your lunch table with your friends and colleagues. After a normal chit-chat, it's time to work again.

After your work is done and you find out that Coldplay is having a live event at Metaverse. You buy their NFT ticket and join them, enjoying their event.

This is what a metaverse life would look like in the future.
